I‚Äôve been on this app for the since 2019 & will honestly be here until I die. Hoping it lasts that long. üôèüèΩ I‚Äôve been searching for a way to understand my spendings between categories, month over month & watching my budget. This is everything & more. I love the personalization that I can add my own catergories, mark a specific merchant as something once and never have to touch it again & even exclude things like transactions between my accounts. This is the app if you‚Äôre anal about how you spend your money & it even helps if I want to budget for let‚Äôs say shopping. I love it. Please note I am a premium user & to me it‚Äôs worth it. But I‚Äôm sure the free version is equally as good. The other apps mint, your bank, random ones only work if you have a goal. But for me, I want to know where, what & compare my spendings month over month so I can see how I‚Äôm doing. Or if I need to stop spending! 

Anyway highly recommend. And two last things- 1) they‚Äôre IT or support literally responds within 48 hours. You‚Äôre never left hanging and no question is stupid. 2) the app is constantly evolving. It‚Äôs not the same as it was two years ago, it‚Äôs better! If there‚Äôs a bug, report it! If you have a suggestion, suggest it! I love all the latest updates & it really helps me think of how I‚Äôm spending my money which was my ultimate goal.

So, I was on the market for a new budgeting app and stumbled upon PocketGuard. I have to say, I‚Äôm extremely impressed. I love the ability to save for my goals without having to think about it. I love how it calculates my estimated monthly income so that I don‚Äôt have to do the mental math when it comes to budgeting. I love the notifications it gives me when I spend too much on a particular category. I love the customizable budget categories (not an option under Mint). This is truly the greatest budgeting app I‚Äôve ever used, and I‚Äôve been budgeting my money very persistently for about a decade now. Also, the customer service is probably the best I‚Äôve ever come into contact with, across any business or platform. You have a question? Email them and you‚Äôll get a response back within 24 hours.

One small thing I would like is to see a number for total food (groceries and eating out combined) somewhere. I am always tracking that, as it‚Äôs the most important area to control.

For months, my Marcus accounts refused to sync, and even though Pocketguards customer service was responsive, the issue took literal months to fix. Everything worked fine for another two months, and then my local bank stopped syncing, and the customer service gave me the same response.

I appreciate the communication and hard work, but when your banks constantly don‚Äôt sync with the app, the app becomes ineffective. Whenever the app finally reconnects to my bank, I‚Äôll have to go back and play catch-up on all my transactions while operating in the dark in the mean time. Now, with this happening twice, I‚Äôll just be paranoid when the next time one of my banks no longer syncs up with PocketGuard.

One feature I‚Äôd love to see though is the option for credit card payment due amounts being included as a bill. That way I can budget for money leftover after bills + cc payments needed. I know this isn‚Äôt useful for those that don‚Äôt carry balances, but for those of us that do, this would make budgeting so much more accurate.

Say you pull the minimum payment amount from each statement as they‚Äôre issued (since the amount can vary month to month) and it would show up as an Upcoming Bill and also deducted from In My Pocket.

After asking support how to delete the back and getting no acknowledgement of the question, I discovered on my own that you can log in to the website through a browser to delete banks.

I had to contact customer support one time and they were incredibly prompt and helpful. I knocked off a star because I wish it was able to do the following (but would have only knocked off only half a star if it was an option):

1) I wish you could choose to carry over unspent budgets to the next month. ie If I underspend this month on ‚Äòhome‚Äô, the budget is bigger the following month to purchase a more expensive item.

2) I wish it could learn and adapt. We pay two bills to Banfield Pet Plan each month that come up as BP. When we buy gas from BP, it goes into bills because it think it‚Äôs the same. So a couple of times a month, I have to manuallly change names and categories - sometimes I have to re-enter the banfield bills and then, when they are paid, they don‚Äôt register as the ones planned. This is a niche and minor issue but slightly annoying nonetheless.

3) I wish it was a little more prompt in identifying new transactions. Sometimes the banking app will detail transactions as no longer pending and it‚Äôll take a day or two for them to appear on PocketGuard.

I spent hours categorizing my transactions so the app could group my expenses properly. But none of that mattered because a core function of the app does not work. A couple weeks after setting up the app, I started noticing that the app was missing multiple transactions from multiple accounts. Meaning that the budgets and quite literally all the calculated data in the app was incorrect! I reached out to app‚Äôs support team but after after weeks of back and forth, the only solution they provided was to use a feature of the paid version of the app to manually add the transactions as cash transactions and then delete the transactions when they fix the problem at some undetermined time in the future. I was even willing to go that route, but the support person could not give me any timeline when the problem would be fixed. In short, the app is broken to the point of being unusable with no fix on the timeline. A further point, they said the issue is with their data aggregator‚Äôs problem with my account issuer and that the problem is affecting a large number of their users. The accounts are with Chase, one of the largest banking networks in the states. I don‚Äôt see how the developers can keep soliciting app downloads and subscriptions when they have such a major flaw with the app that affects so many of their customers while having no timeline to resolve. That‚Äôs very irresponsible so this is definitely not a developer anyone should trust with their finances.

So if you (the developers) could start adding some smaller branch banks in to the system that would be really helpful to linking my account and accurately being able to make a budget and use the app like it‚Äôs supposed to be used. But since you don‚Äôt have the bank that I use in the system I can‚Äôt really use the app like it‚Äôs supposed to be used for because after I got married it turned out that my primary bank account ended up being Apple not BB&T and it‚Äôs not in the system so how am I supposed to be able to use this app if I can‚Äôt link my bank account to get accurate numbers on my budget goals and spending allowance?

Updated Review (updated to 4 stars): My issue below has since been resolved. I was reached out to by support on February 5th, through the review that I left, not by my original support requests. Once I provided my account information they were able to find my support requests and they were able to send a refund to my credit card. I then purchased the lifetime option for PocketGuard plus and have not had any issues so far. 

I give this app 4 stars because it works as advertised. The loss in a star is for my issues with contacting customer support and the inability to cancel a subscription online, which almost every subscription service allows you to do this day and age. I opted to purchase the lifetime option so that last point should no longer matter in my use case. 

This current customer service issue is probably because of the current influx from Mint shutting down, so hopefully it will be a non issue going forward. 

Original Review (1 star):
The app itself works to my liking. However they have charged my credit card for the annual cost, which I never signed up for and support has been impossible to reach in my multiple inquiries. I signed up for the free trial/monthly subscription. Before the end of the free trial I logged in and followed all of the instructions on the website on how to cancel the subscription. My intention was to then purchase the lifetime option. I sent multiple messages through the website portal, and to the direct email. The only thing I have received is an automated response saying they will get back to me. Meanwhile, my credit card has now been charged for the annual cost of the app which I never agreed to pay (I signed up for the monthly subscription). I again sent another email to support about the issue and I have still not received a response. At the time of this review my first message to support was sent on January 25th through the message tab on the website and my last email to them was on January 28th. I will be more than happy to update my review if this gets resolved.",4,TRUE,cteach48,Unauthorized Charges on my Credit Card,positive,,,,,

I will give a couple of reasons I didn‚Äôt give it a full 5 stars under ‚ÄúCons‚Äù. 

Pros: 
1) My accounts will update automatically. This is huge for me because when I used the Mint app, this was not the case. If I had a ‚Äúpending‚Äù purchase in my checking account it would not show on the Mint app, but that is not the case here. I can see all my purchases as soon as I swipe my card. 
2) I am a sucker for a full chart breakdown of my spending, and this app is full of them. 
3) If you need to see QUICKLY how much money you have on hand (for example if your fixing to check out) you can do that under the ‚ÄúIn My Pocket‚Äù amount. 
4) I cannot explain it, but this app has trained me in such a way that I do not usually make a purchase without looking at it first, which is exactly what I need (again I don‚Äôt have great spending habits ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). 

Cons: 
1) The look of the app itself is not as ‚Äúclean‚Äù as I believe it could be. This is minor because it is so functional, but an example would be the pie chart. I love that it shows this, but I wish it was color coded or had something to help each section to stand out more than just the pictures. Another thing that would clean it up is the titles. Please capitalize EVERYTHING that needs to be capitalized. Punctuation is everything. 
2) I live in a rural area so this may have something to do with my issue, but I have had to edit a number of transactions that were not even close to what they actually were. For example, I went to Walmart to buy Groceries, but the transaction was labeled as CVS. These stores are miles from each other. It doesn‚Äôt bother me so much because, again, the app is very functional and easy to edit, but I mention it because if it weren‚Äôt for my bank/Discover app I would be screwed. 

I know this review is long, but I hope it helps. Thank you for providing a system that makes my life so much easier!

Update: If I could bring it back down to 3 stars I would. App is not updating my accounts like it was at first.

It is an ongoing support issue that has yet to be fixed and makes the app useless. 

I‚Äôve tried multiple other apps for budgeting (Mint, YNAB, Quickbook, etc.) but found most to be either too complicated or more focused on working down debt. I wanted something that could: sync my accounts, keep track of transactions, and help me limit spending on different categories- and this app has been perfect for that. 

Positives: Learning to use the app has been quick and easy, able to add multiple bank accounts, credit card payments are automatically excluded from calculations which helps organize transactions, easy to re-label transactions to different budgets, I can see the free version being sufficient for a lot of users, paid version is a reasonable one time fee instead of a yearly subscription. 

Critiques: Would prefer the ‚Äúspending & budgets‚Äù category as a tab on the bottom instead of the ‚Äúfind savings‚Äù tab (which is basically an ad you can‚Äôt get rid of even with a paid account), difficult to set up multiple ‚Äúgoals‚Äù if you only have one savings account, only able to set a budget for a month- would be great to set a yearly budget for big things like travel, home improvement, etc., 
difficulty adding one of my bank accounts (resolved by adding through website instead of mobile app), and this is very minor but aesthetics are a little dated. Being able to choose your own colors, light vs dark mode, updated icons, etc. could really go a long way.

2/11/2020 0:14,,"I am a Plus user and I love the UI/features, however there are some flaws that make me want to use a different app for budgeting purposes and cancel my subscription:

1. I do not get reminder notifications for upcoming bills even though I have notifications turned on for the app. According to PocketGuard you are supposed to receive a notification 3 days before my bill is due but I am not getting that. Also there is no setting for this reminder, you cannot adjust how far in advance this ‚Äúreminder‚Äù occurs.

2. This app does not seem smart enough to handle credit card bills. Every credit card bill is variable, therefore what I paid last month will not be the same this month. PocketGuard acknowledges this by saying ‚Äúthis bill fluctuates‚Äù, however there is an issue with this. When you create the credit card bill from the transaction of you paying it, it will input how much you paid for that bill as how much it should be every month. When the next month bill is due, if I pay a different amount PocketGuard does not recognize that and will tell me my credit card bill is over due, when it is not. This could just be a bug, but still very annoying and I expected better from an app you must pay to use all its features.

3. Transactions from my debit and credit card are really delayed. Any transaction (even pending ones) take 3-4 days after they appear on either account to even show up on PocketGuard. This is not a bank issue as the same accounts are used on the Mint app show up right away, so why does PocketGuard have an issue? This delay causes me issues with budgeting and defeats one of the purposes of the app, tracking how much money is in your pocket each day.

I spent a long time setting it up including going back through 5+ months of imported transactions and cleaning them up with correct categories/tags, identifying recurring bills, etc, only to have it continually miscategorize some of those aforementioned bills even though it should ‚Äúknow‚Äù what they are already, forcing me to rename and recategorize the same things over and over.

The snapshot view - the main reason I went with this one over the countless other similar apps - is useless as well, since PocketGuard artificially inflates some of my upcoming bill amounts seemingly at random, leaving the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in my pocket‚Äù numbers consistently in the red no matter how much I ‚Äútruly have available.‚Äù

The transactions view seems to try and ‚Äúguess‚Äù the name of a new vendor, but instead of interpreting the information it is given (i.e. the vendor name fed to it by the vendor itself), it adds words seemingly out of nowhere, making me think I‚Äôm seeing a fraudulent transaction until I cross-reference my transactions with my bank. For example, a purchase from ‚ÄúCircle Wine and Spirits‚Äù showed up in PocketGuard as ‚ÄúCircle K‚Äù - there are no Circle K locations anywhere near me, so you can see how I‚Äôd be concerned!

11/17/2017 4:16,,"First of all, please keep in mind that I'm looking for a replacement for an app called ""Prosper Daily"".  This app started out with the name BillGuard and then was bought out by Prosper.  After about 2 years, Prosper has decided to shut it down.  I loved this app because it allowed automatic connection to my credit cards (much like PocketGuard does), but with one great feature!  It also allowed me to reconcile my credit cards with an simple swiping method.  This is a feature that I think must be in included in PocketGuard for me to jump on board!  If anyone from PocketGuard is reading this review, please hop on over to Prosper Daily, download the app, and see how this reconciliation works. If you do so, you need to do it soon as Prosper Daily will stop working all together on August 31.  I know there are many people who are more than willing to pay for this feature (a feature that admittedly was free with Prosper Daily, and maybe should not have been).  This would be so helpful!

The other issue I have with  PocketGuard is that I have a Barclays MasterCard and every time I answer the security questions, I get an error saying that the security questions are answered wrong.  The specific error message I get is as follows:  ""Missing or Incorrect MFA Answer"".  I know I am not answering my questions wrong because I have been able to get into the site and actually hook up ProperDaily to it.  I will try to reach out to customer support to see if I can get this problem fixed.

Anyway, I think there is a ton of potential with this app, and like I said, I would be more than willing to pay for the Plus package to get this.  I guess I will have to wait to see what PocketGuard decides to do here.

But in practice, it‚Äôs really not working. I‚Äôve been working with it for a few months, but I‚Äôm about done. 

Things that I‚Äôve marked as ‚Äúbills‚Äù constantly drop off, and I have to figure out what is missing. I‚Äôve had older transactions just disappear. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly having to double check that everything is right, and constantly having to make adjustments and contact support, which is making money management harder, not easier. 

It takes way too long to reconcile a pending transaction as a bill. You have to wait till it is no longer pending, which means you can be hanging out for 3 days with an inaccurate ‚Äúin my pocket‚Äù figure. 

You can‚Äôt change dates, and transactions often get stuck onto the date they clear rather than the date they happen. So if you do something right on the cusp of one month, it will probably end up attached to the next month. Sure, for small things, this doesn‚Äôt matter, but when it‚Äôs a $2000 transaction, it really does. 

It also doesn‚Äôt deal with positive transactions, which seems like a pretty essential function. So if you have a return at a store, foot the bill and have your friends pay you back, or get a credit for anything, it just doesn‚Äôt count. 

I‚Äôve stuck with it this long because it is exactly how I want to be visualizing my money. And I do have to say that support is usually very helpful and works to try to fix things. But overall, it‚Äôs not working as well as it should.",2,TRUE,SplatW,It‚Äôs not there yet.,positive,,,,,

1. Certain account connections seems to be consistently unreliable. Two of my accounts in particular repeatedly have connection issues; when I go to fix them, the app claims the credentials are incorrect (I know for sure the credentials are correct), then appears to connect anyway.

2. The automated bill trackings ‚Äì¬†while nice ‚Äì¬†is not perfect, and with no way to manually correct the issues this can cause a lot of problems. For example, let's say you and your partner both have student loans from the same lender, and make your payments on roughly the same day each month. I have this exact setup through two different lenders (four bill payments total), but PocketGuard *always* merges the payments so that it looks like there's only one bill payment to each lender.

Edit: You didn't add more features with the Premium version. You took the majority of pockets that prior to the update were free and now make them only available in the Premium paid version. Pretty sneaky.

While easily 90%+ of my transactions occur electronically in one form or another, keeping track of my cash is probably the hardest part of budgeting and what I really wanted an app to do. 
2. You cannot split transactions between two or more categories. So, I go to the atm and grab $100 cash because I need to put $25 in a birthday card for my niece, $20 for gas (paying cash is cheaper), stopping for bagels $10, etc.  There's no way for me to allocate that $100 into multiple categories.

Simply put, some pay periods have one extra day or less a day or even. This app doesn‚Äôt account for those variations or allow to to program that algorithm.

There are many useful budgeting features, but the ones that I like the most are ¬´In My Pocket¬ª, spending pie-chart and spending limits.

This app used to be amazing, but ever since the database transfer that happened around November, transactions have not been populating until 2-3 days after. The reason people use the app is to help assist with budgeting and making sure one does not overspend throughout the week/weekend. We can't do that if we are looking at old data. 

(5/2016)
What Level Money used to be and more! Only thing I wish it has was the ability to change the date for transactions. So say if I wanted to by my groceries at the end of 1 month for the next, I'd like to have it count towards my next month's budget.",1,FALSE,Aalvarez01,Great!,positive,,,,,
