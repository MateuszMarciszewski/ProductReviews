Which is the problem: once you set it, you forget it and you drift away from your spending plan.  The beauty of YNAB is that it is flexible and dynamic, and allows you to adjust your spending plan as you need to. I found the program itself is well designed, reliable, and easy to use. The only issues I‚Äôve had were with banks making it hard to set up connectivity. But YNAB did a good job of communicating how they were working to resolve the issues.  In the beginning it does take a few hours to set up categories and get banks connected,  mainly because it is so customizable, but once it is set up it is virtually effortless to maintain. Do watch the tutorials first on how to set it up.  But then  I spend 1 to 3 minutes each morning reviewing the previous days expenditures, and maybe 10 minutes a month reconciling my accounts. It shows monthly and quarterly reports so I can see trends over time. The only tricky bit is understanding how YNAB budgets your credit card purchases. That is not intuitive the way the rest of the program is. But they produce tutorials that explain it well. The web platform is easiest to use for setting up your categories, and for reconciliation. But the phone app is essential for quickly checking your remaining budgets on the go, especially as you get close to your next payday.

This app/way of tagging and budgeting really helped me see in a very adult way, the ways in which I was failing to connect some financial dots and keep myself from doing as well as I should have been; it made sense after I really pressed myself to drop my bad thinking that I had developed to try and work around the natural holes in a standard budget logic.

Having said all of that, I find myself using my iPad Pro to access the web client, as the app itself is so kiddy and limited that it makes it actually harder to digest the information presented and make the most sense of it. So much information but it‚Äôs all so ‚Äúbig‚Äù that you can‚Äôt see the big picture, almost simply because the text and forms are so LARGE. Really the app could be and needs to be as feature-rich and dense as the web app; basically take the web app and adapt it to be touch targets and color coded like the app is.

I really love YNAB! It has helped us tremendously with our budget and is easy to use. For me, the app is a bit smoother and simpler to use than the website.

And I have 3 different budgets (sometimes 4 if I am traveling) I wish there was an easy way to switch between them (while we are at it, the web app could use easier budget switching ..). Also, maybe add in a title somewhere which budget I have opened? A few times I have logged in things in the wrong budget, because I didn‚Äôt realize I had the wrong one open

I got a free year through my school starting in the fall of my senior year, so I got used to using this before entering the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. Having someone speak to us at school about it in person helped make it easy to understand right away. I highly recommend the online tutorials as well because there is a lot more to YNAB than is obvious. It has been insanely helpful as I take on more expenses and money management gets more complex. $85 a year is a little high, but thanks to the app I‚Äôm able to plan for it! I used to keep up with homemade excel budget, but I can‚Äôt ever imagine going back to that. 

Pro tip: add widgets to your Home Screen! I added one for some of my main monthly categories like groceries and gas. Then you can stack them all together and scroll through them in one single box on your Home Screen. Plus, you can click on the widget for the category shown and it takes you right to a screen to add a transaction for that category.

After years of overdraft fees, my sister in law helped us create a budget. What started as a complicated Excel spreadsheet, was replaced with the ease of YNAB (which she also recommended). We went from living paycheck to paycheck to having a constant cushion and saving for the future. In the past, a costly emergency would send us into more debt. Now, all it does is adjust our funds for a bit. While the annual fee may feel like a barrier, I PROMISE you it‚Äôs worth it. 

On top of everything, the customer service is EXCELLENT. There have been a couple of times that I have had some minor issues (usually created by me) and the chat and emails back and forth were incredibly helpful.

I used to not understand where my money went every month, and each month I found myself spending pretty much all of what I made. With YNAB I was able to develop a complete picture of my finances and through the power of budgeting begin actually SAVING money every month.

I love YNAB. Aside from being a phenomenal personal finance tool, it‚Äôs great software. The app and website are both fast and well-designed. I use either the app or the website on a daily basis!

I really appreciate that YNAB has recently been improving the ‚Äúreports‚Äù section of the app (recently renamed to ‚Äúreflect‚Äù). Reporting has always been a weakness of YNAB, but with the recent changes to reflect I‚Äôm seeing the beginnings of some really nice reporting tools.

One request for reflect: you have options to see stats for the most recent three/six/12 months, but these presets include the current month. I would like to be able to see stats for the trailing three months exclusive of the current month, since the current month is generally always incomplete and can lead to misleading reports being generated, especially for the spending breakdown report.",5,False,Life-Changing and worth every penny,ifurreadingthisits2late,positive

The balance of my credit card is never accurate, it‚Äôs difficult to understand your total spending vs total budget for the month, and cash flows don‚Äôt work with my monthly payment cycle. It‚Äôs been more reliable to eyeball the spending across my accounts than to follow YNAB‚Äôs numbers.

This is disappointing because much of the functionality and idea is great and had given me some insight into where my money is going.

It takes a little getting used to since most other budgeting apps have no correlation to the cash in the bank.

This app allows you to plan and stay on top of your finances but allows for flexibility when you need to, all the while staying within what you have and not overspending.

I, frankly, was not happy when they went cloud-based, I would still prefer to keep my data locally, but I've tried many alternatives, and none even come close to YNAB.

Our one area of disagreement with YNAB, and this has been a strong issue with Jessie as we have corresponded, is income.  There is no way to budget income in YNAB.  While one can work with saved money easily enough, it is difficult to schedule income and budgets months in advance in a real world scenario.

The dealbreaker for me is the complete lack of flexibility to go negative on any carryover categories. I recognize that this is not ideal for budgeting, but it is a reality of life. This forces you to jump through hoops by mis-categorizing transactions or changing your current monthly budget (only to have to change it back in future months).
